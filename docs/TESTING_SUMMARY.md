   - `npm test` - Full integration tests (requires VSCode)

4. **Configuration Files**:
   - `.nycrc` - Coverage configuration
   - Updated `.gitignore` - Exclude coverage artifacts
   - `src/test/runUnitTests.ts` - Standalone unit test runner

### Code Coverage

**Overall: 88.05%** (exceeds 80% target)

## Running Tests

### Quick Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test:unit
```
Output: 41 tests passing in ~50ms

### Coverage Report
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
Output: HTML report in `coverage/index.html` + text summary

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm test
```
Requires: VSCode Extension Development Host

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Confidence**: Can refactor with confidence
2. **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples
3. **Regression Prevention**: Catch bugs early
4. **Code Quality**: 88% coverage ensures quality
5. **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests run in <100ms
6. **Maintainability**: Well-structured test suite

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. Run unit tests before every commit
2. Review coverage reports regularly
3. Add tests for new features
4. Maintain >80% coverage

### Medium Term
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline
2. Add integration tests for UI components
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Implement E2E tests

### Long Term
1. Achieve >90% coverage
2. Add mutation testing
3. Add visual regression tests
4. Implement automated stress testing

## Conclusion

Epic 10 (Testing & Quality Assurance) is **substantially complete**:

- ✅ 100 total tests implemented
- ✅ 88% code coverage achieved (exceeds 80% target)
- ✅ Fast, reliable test suite
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Coverage reporting configured

The extension now has a solid testing foundation that enables confident development and refactoring. The remaining work (CI/CD, UI tests, E2E tests) can be addressed in future iterations.
