## Bug Fixes (Post Manual Testing)

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:

All critical bugs have been fixed! The extension now works correctly for:

- ‚úÖ Adding notes
- ‚úÖ 1st edit
- ‚úÖ 2nd edit
- ‚úÖ 3rd+ edits
- ‚úÖ Multiple edits without reloading

**1. Edit note error: "id not found" (persistent on 2nd/3rd attempt)**

- **Issue**: Sometimes editing a note would fail with "Note with id xxxx not found", especially on the 2nd or 3rd edit attempt
- **Root Cause - Fundamental Design Flaw**: The system was using **content hash as the filename**, but a single note can have many different content hashes over its lifetime as the underlying code changes. This created duplicate files with the same note ID, causing confusion and failures.
- **Attempted Fixes** (that didn't work):
  1. Changed `updateNote()` to use `getAllNotesForFile()` - didn't fix the root cause
  2. Created `loadAllNotes()` method - still didn't fix the duplication issue
  3. Added `deleteNoteFile()` to clean up old files - still failed because of timing issues
  4. Added deduplication logic - band-aid solution that masked the real problem
- **Final Solution - Complete Architecture Change**:
  1. **Changed filename strategy from content-hash to note-ID**: Files are now named `{noteId}.md` instead of `{contentHash}.md`
  2. Each note always writes to the SAME file throughout its lifetime, regardless of content hash changes
  3. Content hash is now just metadata inside the file, not the filename
  4. Removed all the complex deduplication and cleanup logic - no longer needed
  5. Updated all methods: `getNoteFilePath()`, `saveNote()`, `loadNoteById()` (renamed from `loadNoteByHash`)
  6. Removed `deleteNoteFile()` method - no longer needed
  7. Updated interface: replaced `loadNoteByHash()` with `loadNoteById()`
  8. Fixed all 22 unit tests to use new naming convention
- **Why this works**: A note ID never changes - it's the stable identifier. Using it as the filename ensures one file per note, eliminating all duplication issues.
- **Location**:
  - `src/storageManager.ts` - changed `getNoteFilePath()` to use note ID, renamed `loadNoteByHash()` to `loadNoteById()`, removed `deleteNoteFile()`
  - `src/noteManager.ts` - simplified `updateNote()` (no more file deletion), removed `deduplicateNotes()`
  - `src/types.ts` - updated NoteStorage interface with `loadNoteById()` instead of `loadNoteByHash()` and `deleteNoteFile()`
  - `src/test/suite/storageManager.test.ts` - updated all 22 tests to use new naming

**2. CodeLens showing markdown formatting**

- **Issue**: CodeLens preview was showing raw markdown syntax like `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `[link](url)`
- **Root Cause**: The preview text wasn't stripping markdown formatting
- **Fix**: Added `stripMarkdown()` helper function that removes all markdown formatting (bold, italic, links, code blocks, headings, lists, etc.) before displaying in CodeLens
- **Location**: `src/codeLensProvider.ts` lines 91-121

**3. Second edit fails with "id not found" - File path issue**

- **Issue**: After the first edit succeeds, the second edit would fail with "Note with id xxxx not found"
- **Root Cause**: When editing a note in VSCode's comment UI, VSCode creates a temporary virtual document (e.g., `/commentinput-4-1760641478387.md`) for the input field. The save command was using `activeTextEditor.document` which pointed to this temporary document instead of the actual source file. This meant we were looking for the note in the wrong file, resulting in "not found" errors.
- **Fix**:
  1. Changed the save command to use note ID only, without relying on active editor
  2. Created new `saveEditedNoteById()` method in CommentController that retrieves the correct file path from the comment thread
  3. The thread is stored by note ID and contains the correct URI of the source file
  4. Now opens the correct document using `thread.uri.fsPath` before updating
- **Why this works**: The comment thread is always attached to the real source file, not the temporary input document. By using the thread's URI, we always update the note in the correct file.
- **Location**:
  - `src/extension.ts` - updated `saveNoteCommand` to use new method (lines 348-370)
  - `src/commentController.ts` - added `saveEditedNoteById()` method (lines 454-477)

**4. Removed reaction icons from comment editor**

- **Issue**: VSCode comment UI was showing reaction icons (thumbs up, etc.) that weren't needed for this extension in all operations (view, edit, history)
- **Root Cause**: The `reactionHandler` was being set in the CommentController, and the Comment interface's `reactions` property was not being controlled properly
- **Fix**:
  1. Removed the `reactionHandler` setting from the CommentController constructor (line 55-57)
  2. Ensured `reactions` property is NOT set on any comment objects (left undefined instead of empty array)
  3. Per VSCode API: If `reactions` is undefined, the reaction UI is not displayed
- **Why this works**:
  1. By not setting a `reactionHandler`, VSCode knows the controller doesn't support reactions
  2. By leaving `reactions` undefined (not setting it at all), VSCode won't display reaction UI for individual comments
  3. Setting `reactions: []` would still show the reaction UI (just empty), while `undefined` hides it completely
- **Location**:
  - `src/commentController.ts` - removed `reactionHandler` assignment (line 55-57)
  - `src/commentController.ts` - removed `reactions` property from `createComment()` method (line 118)
  - `src/commentController.ts` - removed `reactions` property from history comments in `showHistoryInThread()` (line 410)
  - `src/commentController.ts` - removed `reactions` property from editable comments in `enableEditMode()` (line 446)

**5. Fixed "command not found" errors in production VSIX (Initial attempt - v0.1.2)**

- **Issue**: Commands like `codeContextNotes.insertCodeBlock` and `codeContextNotes.addNote` were not found when using the extension installed from VSIX
- **Root Cause (Partial)**: The `activationEvents` in package.json included individual `onCommand` entries for only some commands
- **Fix (Partial)**: Simplified `activationEvents` to only use `"onStartupFinished"`
- **Location**: `package.json` - simplified `activationEvents` to only `["onStartupFinished"]` (line 36-38)
- **Version**: v0.1.2 (Partial fix - still had issues)

**6. Fixed "command not found" errors - Complete fix (v0.1.3)**

- **Issue**: Even after v0.1.2, commands like `codeContextNotes.addNote` were still not found when extension was installed from VSIX
- **Root Cause (The Real Problem)**: The `activate()` function had a fatal flaw:
  ```typescript
  if (!workspaceFolder) {
      registerLimitedCommands(context);  // Only registered 4 commands
      return;  // EARLY RETURN - never called registerCommands()!
  }
  // ... registerCommands() called here, but only if workspace exists
  ```
  When no workspace folder was detected (or before one was detected), the extension would call `registerLimitedCommands()` which only registered 4 stub commands, then RETURN early. This meant `registerCommands()` was NEVER called, so ALL commands were missing. Even worse, this could happen in production if the extension activated before the workspace was fully detected.
- **Fix**:
  1. Moved ALL command registration to the very beginning of `activate()` function, before any workspace checks
  2. Renamed `registerCommands()` to `registerAllCommands()` and removed `registerLimitedCommands()`
  3. Added workspace checks INSIDE each command that needs workspace features (noteManager, commentController)
  4. Commands now show helpful error messages if workspace is not available, rather than failing to register
- **Why this works**:
  1. ALL commands are registered immediately when extension activates, regardless of workspace state
  2. Commands are always available in command palette, keybindings, and menus
  3. Individual commands check for required dependencies (noteManager, commentController) and show friendly error messages if not available
  4. Works in ALL scenarios: with workspace, without workspace, before workspace detected, after workspace detected
- **Location**:
  - `src/extension.ts` - moved `registerAllCommands(context)` to line 29 (before workspace check)
  - `src/extension.ts` - removed `registerLimitedCommands()` function
  - `src/extension.ts` - renamed `registerCommands()` to `registerAllCommands()`
  - `src/extension.ts` - added workspace checks to commands that need them (lines 161, 204, 221, 238, etc.)
- **Version**: Fixed in v0.1.3

**7. Fixed "Cannot find package 'vscode'" error in Cursor (v0.1.5)**

- **Issue**: Extension installed from Open VSX registry in Cursor failed with error: `Error: Cannot find package 'vscode' imported from /Users/nahian/.cursor/extensions/jnahian.code-context-notes-0.1.4-universal/out/extension.js`
- **Root Cause**: The extension was using ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json) and compiling TypeScript to individual .js files, but VSCode extensions need to be bundled as CommonJS with the `vscode` module externalized. The `vscode` module is not a real npm package - it's provided by the VSCode/Cursor runtime and must be properly externalized during bundling.
- **Fix**:
  1. Installed esbuild as dev dependency for proper bundling
  2. Created `esbuild.config.js` with CommonJS output format and `vscode` as external
  3. Updated package.json scripts to use esbuild for compilation (`npm run compile`)
  4. Removed `"type": "module"` from package.json (CommonJS is default)
  5. Updated `.vscodeignore` to exclude source files and build config
  6. Extension now bundles to a single 32KB `out/extension.js` file in CommonJS format
- **Why this works**:
  1. esbuild bundles all TypeScript code into a single CommonJS file
  2. The `vscode` module is marked as external, so it's not bundled but imported at runtime
  3. CommonJS format is the standard for VSCode extensions and works in all editors (VSCode, Cursor, etc.)
  4. Bundling reduces package size and improves load performance
- **Location**:
  - `esbuild.config.js` - new file with bundling configuration
  - `package.json` - updated scripts (compile, watch) and removed "type": "module"
  - `.vscodeignore` - updated to exclude esbuild config and individual compiled files
  - `package.json` - added esbuild, @vscode/vsce, and ovsx as dev dependencies
- **Version**: Fixed in v0.1.5 (pending release)

**8. Fixed test coverage configuration (Post esbuild migration)**

- **Issue**: After migrating to esbuild, the nyc coverage tool was reporting 0% coverage and referencing a missing package `@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript`
- **Root Cause**:
  1. The `.nycrc` file was extending `@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript` which was not installed
  2. The include path `out/src/**/*.js` was incorrect - compiled files are in `out/` not `out/src/`
- **Fix**:
  1. Removed the `extends` field from `.nycrc` to avoid dependency on missing package
  2. Updated include path from `out/src/**/*.js` to `out/**/*.js`
  3. Removed redundant exclude path `out/src/test/**`
- **Why this works**:
  1. nyc now uses its default configuration without requiring additional packages
  2. Correct include path matches the actual compiled file structure
  3. All unit tests continue to pass (41 tests)
- **Location**:
  - `.nycrc` - simplified configuration (lines 1-23)
- **Version**: Fixed in v0.1.5 (pending release)

**Test Status After Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ 41 unit tests passing (storageManager: 22 tests, gitIntegration: 19 tests)
- ‚úÖ All tests compatible with esbuild bundling
- ‚úÖ Tests run using TypeScript compilation (compile:tsc) for easier debugging
- ‚úÖ Production extension uses esbuild for optimal bundle size and performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage reporting still needs adjustment for esbuild bundled output (low priority)

**9. Fixed keyboard shortcuts not using modern comment UI (Post v0.1.4)**

- **Issue**: Multiple keyboard shortcuts were using old UI patterns instead of the modern comment editor interface
  1. Ctrl+Alt+N (Cmd+Alt+N) for adding notes used a simple input box
  2. Ctrl+Alt+H (Cmd+Alt+H) for viewing history opened a separate markdown document
- **Root Cause**:
  1. The `addNote` command used `vscode.window.showInputBox()` instead of the comment editor
  2. The `viewHistory` command used `vscode.window.showTextDocument()` instead of showing history in the comment thread
  3. These were inconsistent with the modern UI used by buttons (which properly use comment threads)
- **Fix**: Updated both commands to use the comment controller methods:
  1. `addNote` now uses `commentController.openCommentEditor()` (same as CodeLens)
  2. `viewHistory` now uses `commentController.showHistoryInThread()` (same as history button)
- **Why this works**:
  1. **For addNote**: Comment editor provides multi-line input, markdown support, formatting shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+B, I, K), and Save/Cancel buttons
  2. **For viewHistory**: History displays inline in the comment thread, preserving context and allowing users to stay in their editor
  3. Consistent UX across all interaction methods (keyboard shortcuts, buttons, and CodeLens)
  4. Better integration with VSCode's native comment system
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Status**:
  - ‚úÖ **Ctrl+Alt+N** - Add Note (now opens comment editor)
  - ‚úÖ **Ctrl+Alt+H** - View History (now shows in comment thread)
  - ‚úÖ **Ctrl+Alt+D** - Delete Note (already correct - shows confirmation dialog)
  - ‚úÖ **Ctrl+Alt+R** - Refresh Notes (already correct - refreshes UI)
  - ‚úÖ **Ctrl/Cmd+B, I, K, etc.** - Markdown formatting (only work in comment editor)
- **Location**:
  - `src/extension.ts` - updated `addNote` command (lines 167-196)
  - `src/extension.ts` - updated `viewHistory` command (lines 282-318)
- **Version**: Fixed in v0.1.5 (pending release)

**10. Fixed + icon comment editor not saving notes (Post v0.1.4)**

- **Issue**: When clicking the + icon in the editor gutter to add a comment without selecting code, the comment editor opens but clicking Save doesn't save the note
- **Root Cause**: The `handleSaveNewNote` method expected threads to have custom properties (`tempId` and `sourceDocument`) that are only set by our `openCommentEditor()` method. When VSCode creates threads via the + icon, these properties don't exist, causing the method to fail silently because it couldn't find the document
- **Fix**: Updated `handleSaveNewNote` to handle both cases:
  1. Threads created by our code (via keyboard shortcuts or CodeLens) - uses the custom `sourceDocument` property
  2. Threads created by VSCode's + icon - finds the document by matching URIs from `vscode.workspace.textDocuments`
  3. Falls back to `vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(thread.uri)` if document not found in workspace
  4. Shows error message if document still cannot be found
- **Why this works**:
  1. The thread always has a `uri` property regardless of how it was created
  2. We can reliably find the document by matching its URI
  3. Handles all thread creation scenarios: keyboard shortcuts, CodeLens, and VSCode's native + icon
  4. Provides clear error messages if document cannot be found
- **Location**:
  - `src/commentController.ts` - updated `handleSaveNewNote` method (lines 240-298)
- **Version**: Fixed in v0.1.5 (pending release)


## Enhancement: Auto-Collapse All Other Notes

**Task:** Auto-collapse all other notes when opening/editing/viewing a note
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** October 19, 2025

**Implementation:**

1. **New Helper Method: `closeAllCommentEditors()`** (commentController.ts:198-220)
   - Collapses ALL comment threads (not just expanded ones)
   - Distinguishes between temporary threads (new notes) and editing threads
   - Disposes temporary/editing threads completely
   - Collapses all other threads regardless of current state
   - Ensures only one note is visible at a time

2. **Updated Methods:**
   - ‚úÖ `openCommentEditor()` - Collapses all others before opening new note editor
   - ‚úÖ `enableEditMode()` - Collapses all others before editing existing note
   - ‚úÖ `focusNoteThread()` - Collapses all others before viewing/expanding note

3. **Behavior:**
   - When adding a new note (keyboard/CodeLens) ‚Üí ALL other notes collapse
   - When editing an existing note ‚Üí ALL other notes collapse
   - When viewing a note ‚Üí ALL other notes collapse
   - Only one note visible at a time for better focus
   - Cleaner, more focused editing experience with reduced visual clutter

4. **Testing:**
   - ‚úÖ Code compiles successfully
   - ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
   - ‚úÖ Build passes with esbuild

**Location:**
- `src/commentController.ts` - added `closeAllCommentEditors()` method (lines 198-220)
- `src/commentController.ts` - updated `openCommentEditor()` (line 233)
- `src/commentController.ts` - updated `enableEditMode()` (line 492)
- `src/commentController.ts` - updated `focusNoteThread()` (line 420)

**Version**: v0.1.5

## Enhancement: Full Note Hiding When Opening New Editor

**Task:** Completely hide all note editors when opening a new one (not just collapse input)
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** October 19, 2025

**Implementation:**

1. **Updated `closeAllCommentEditors()` Method** (commentController.ts:209-220)
   - Changed behavior from selective collapse to complete disposal
   - Now disposes ALL comment threads completely (temp, editing, expanded, and collapsed)
   - Clears all threads from the tracking map
   - Ensures complete hiding from the editor view

2. **Previous Behavior:**
   - Temporary/editing threads were disposed
   - Expanded threads were collapsed
   - Already collapsed threads stayed collapsed
   - Result: Notes were still visible in collapsed state

3. **New Behavior:**
   - ALL threads disposed completely regardless of state
   - All threads removed from tracking map
   - Result: Full hiding - no notes visible in editor at all
   - Only the new editor being opened will be visible

4. **Why This Works:**
   - Disposal completely removes threads from the UI (not just collapses them)
   - Clearing the map ensures clean state
   - When a note is saved, a new thread is created via `createCommentThread()`
   - User sees only the one note they're working on at any time

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner, more focused editing experience
- No visual clutter from collapsed notes
- Improved concentration on current task
- Better UX for note management

**Testing:**
- ‚úÖ Code compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ Build passes with esbuild

**Location:**
- `src/commentController.ts` - simplified `closeAllCommentEditors()` method (lines 209-220)

**Version**: v0.1.5

## Enhancement: Ctrl+Enter Keyboard Shortcut for Saving Notes

**Task:** Add Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac) keyboard shortcut to save/update notes
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** October 19, 2025

**Implementation:**

1. **New Keybinding Added** (package.json:195-200)
   - Command: `codeContextNotes.saveNote`
   - Key: `ctrl+enter` (Windows/Linux)
   - Key: `cmd+enter` (macOS)
   - Context: `commentEditorFocused` (only active in comment editor)

2. **Behavior:**
   - When creating a new note: Press Ctrl+Enter to save the note
   - When editing an existing note: Press Ctrl+Enter to save changes
   - Only works when focused in the comment editor input field
   - Same command as the Save button in the UI

3. **Benefits:**
   - Faster workflow - no need to click the Save button
   - Familiar keyboard shortcut (common in many apps)
   - Consistent with VSCode's comment submission patterns
   - Works for both new notes and updates

**Testing:**
- ‚úÖ Code compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ Build passes with esbuild

**Location:**
- `package.json` - added keybinding configuration (lines 195-200)

**Version**: v0.1.5

## UI Improvement: Enhanced Labels with Relevant Information

**Task:** Improve labels across all note views with more relevant, useful information
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** October 19, 2025

**Implementation:**

1. **New Note Editor** (openCommentEditor - line 256)
   - Label: `"Add your note"`
   - Clearer call-to-action instead of generic "Start discussion"

2. **View/Edit Notes** (createComment - lines 98-115)
   - Smart label showing update status:
     - If note has been edited: `"Last updated [date]"`
     - If note is new (no history): `"Created [date]"`
   - Automatically detects most recent change from history
   - Provides at-a-glance information about note freshness

3. **History Entries** (showHistoryInThread - lines 464-481)
   - Descriptive label: `"[Action] on [date] at [time]"`
   - Example: `"Updated on 10/19/2025 at 2:30:00 PM"`
   - Shows action type (Created, Updated, Deleted) with full timestamp
   - Content in body (without action prefix for cleaner display)

**Benefits:**
- More informative labels that provide useful context
- Users can quickly see when notes were last modified
- History entries clearly show what action was taken and when
- Better UX with actionable and informative labels
- Maintains clean UI while adding valuable information

**Testing:**
- ‚úÖ Code compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ Build passes with esbuild

**Location:**
- `src/commentController.ts` - enhanced label in `openCommentEditor()` (line 256)
- `src/commentController.ts` - smart label logic in `createComment()` (lines 98-115)
- `src/commentController.ts` - detailed label in `showHistoryInThread()` (lines 464-481)

**Version**: v0.1.5
