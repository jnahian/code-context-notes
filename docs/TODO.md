## Bug Fixes (Post Manual Testing)

### ✅ Fixed Issues:

All critical bugs have been fixed! The extension now works correctly for:
- ✅ Adding notes
- ✅ 1st edit
- ✅ 2nd edit
- ✅ 3rd+ edits
- ✅ Multiple edits without reloading

**1. Edit note error: "id not found" (persistent on 2nd/3rd attempt)**
- **Issue**: Sometimes editing a note would fail with "Note with id xxxx not found", especially on the 2nd or 3rd edit attempt
- **Root Cause - Fundamental Design Flaw**: The system was using **content hash as the filename**, but a single note can have many different content hashes over its lifetime as the underlying code changes. This created duplicate files with the same note ID, causing confusion and failures.
- **Attempted Fixes** (that didn't work):
  1. Changed `updateNote()` to use `getAllNotesForFile()` - didn't fix the root cause
  2. Created `loadAllNotes()` method - still didn't fix the duplication issue
  3. Added `deleteNoteFile()` to clean up old files - still failed because of timing issues
  4. Added deduplication logic - band-aid solution that masked the real problem
- **Final Solution - Complete Architecture Change**:
  1. **Changed filename strategy from content-hash to note-ID**: Files are now named `{noteId}.md` instead of `{contentHash}.md`
  2. Each note always writes to the SAME file throughout its lifetime, regardless of content hash changes
  3. Content hash is now just metadata inside the file, not the filename
  4. Removed all the complex deduplication and cleanup logic - no longer needed
  5. Updated all methods: `getNoteFilePath()`, `saveNote()`, `loadNoteById()` (renamed from `loadNoteByHash`)
  6. Removed `deleteNoteFile()` method - no longer needed
  7. Updated interface: replaced `loadNoteByHash()` with `loadNoteById()`
  8. Fixed all 22 unit tests to use new naming convention
- **Why this works**: A note ID never changes - it's the stable identifier. Using it as the filename ensures one file per note, eliminating all duplication issues.
- **Location**:
  - `src/storageManager.ts` - changed `getNoteFilePath()` to use note ID, renamed `loadNoteByHash()` to `loadNoteById()`, removed `deleteNoteFile()`
  - `src/noteManager.ts` - simplified `updateNote()` (no more file deletion), removed `deduplicateNotes()`
  - `src/types.ts` - updated NoteStorage interface with `loadNoteById()` instead of `loadNoteByHash()` and `deleteNoteFile()`
  - `src/test/suite/storageManager.test.ts` - updated all 22 tests to use new naming

**2. CodeLens showing markdown formatting**
- **Issue**: CodeLens preview was showing raw markdown syntax like `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `[link](url)`
- **Root Cause**: The preview text wasn't stripping markdown formatting
- **Fix**: Added `stripMarkdown()` helper function that removes all markdown formatting (bold, italic, links, code blocks, headings, lists, etc.) before displaying in CodeLens
- **Location**: `src/codeLensProvider.ts` lines 91-121

**3. Second edit fails with "id not found" - File path issue**
- **Issue**: After the first edit succeeds, the second edit would fail with "Note with id xxxx not found"
- **Root Cause**: When editing a note in VSCode's comment UI, VSCode creates a temporary virtual document (e.g., `/commentinput-4-1760641478387.md`) for the input field. The save command was using `activeTextEditor.document` which pointed to this temporary document instead of the actual source file. This meant we were looking for the note in the wrong file, resulting in "not found" errors.
- **Fix**:
  1. Changed the save command to use note ID only, without relying on active editor
  2. Created new `saveEditedNoteById()` method in CommentController that retrieves the correct file path from the comment thread
  3. The thread is stored by note ID and contains the correct URI of the source file
  4. Now opens the correct document using `thread.uri.fsPath` before updating
- **Why this works**: The comment thread is always attached to the real source file, not the temporary input document. By using the thread's URI, we always update the note in the correct file.
- **Location**:
  - `src/extension.ts` - updated `saveNoteCommand` to use new method (lines 348-370)
  - `src/commentController.ts` - added `saveEditedNoteById()` method (lines 454-477)
