## Bug Fixes (Post Manual Testing)

### ✅ Fixed Issues:

All critical bugs have been fixed! The extension now works correctly for:

- ✅ Adding notes
- ✅ 1st edit
- ✅ 2nd edit
- ✅ 3rd+ edits
- ✅ Multiple edits without reloading

**1. Edit note error: "id not found" (persistent on 2nd/3rd attempt)**

- **Issue**: Sometimes editing a note would fail with "Note with id xxxx not found", especially on the 2nd or 3rd edit attempt
- **Root Cause - Fundamental Design Flaw**: The system was using **content hash as the filename**, but a single note can have many different content hashes over its lifetime as the underlying code changes. This created duplicate files with the same note ID, causing confusion and failures.
- **Attempted Fixes** (that didn't work):
  1. Changed `updateNote()` to use `getAllNotesForFile()` - didn't fix the root cause
  2. Created `loadAllNotes()` method - still didn't fix the duplication issue
  3. Added `deleteNoteFile()` to clean up old files - still failed because of timing issues
  4. Added deduplication logic - band-aid solution that masked the real problem
- **Final Solution - Complete Architecture Change**:
  1. **Changed filename strategy from content-hash to note-ID**: Files are now named `{noteId}.md` instead of `{contentHash}.md`
  2. Each note always writes to the SAME file throughout its lifetime, regardless of content hash changes
  3. Content hash is now just metadata inside the file, not the filename
  4. Removed all the complex deduplication and cleanup logic - no longer needed
  5. Updated all methods: `getNoteFilePath()`, `saveNote()`, `loadNoteById()` (renamed from `loadNoteByHash`)
  6. Removed `deleteNoteFile()` method - no longer needed
  7. Updated interface: replaced `loadNoteByHash()` with `loadNoteById()`
  8. Fixed all 22 unit tests to use new naming convention
- **Why this works**: A note ID never changes - it's the stable identifier. Using it as the filename ensures one file per note, eliminating all duplication issues.
- **Location**:
  - `src/storageManager.ts` - changed `getNoteFilePath()` to use note ID, renamed `loadNoteByHash()` to `loadNoteById()`, removed `deleteNoteFile()`
  - `src/noteManager.ts` - simplified `updateNote()` (no more file deletion), removed `deduplicateNotes()`
  - `src/types.ts` - updated NoteStorage interface with `loadNoteById()` instead of `loadNoteByHash()` and `deleteNoteFile()`
  - `src/test/suite/storageManager.test.ts` - updated all 22 tests to use new naming

**2. CodeLens showing markdown formatting**

- **Issue**: CodeLens preview was showing raw markdown syntax like `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `[link](url)`
- **Root Cause**: The preview text wasn't stripping markdown formatting
- **Fix**: Added `stripMarkdown()` helper function that removes all markdown formatting (bold, italic, links, code blocks, headings, lists, etc.) before displaying in CodeLens
- **Location**: `src/codeLensProvider.ts` lines 91-121

**3. Second edit fails with "id not found" - File path issue**

- **Issue**: After the first edit succeeds, the second edit would fail with "Note with id xxxx not found"
- **Root Cause**: When editing a note in VSCode's comment UI, VSCode creates a temporary virtual document (e.g., `/commentinput-4-1760641478387.md`) for the input field. The save command was using `activeTextEditor.document` which pointed to this temporary document instead of the actual source file. This meant we were looking for the note in the wrong file, resulting in "not found" errors.
- **Fix**:
  1. Changed the save command to use note ID only, without relying on active editor
  2. Created new `saveEditedNoteById()` method in CommentController that retrieves the correct file path from the comment thread
  3. The thread is stored by note ID and contains the correct URI of the source file
  4. Now opens the correct document using `thread.uri.fsPath` before updating
- **Why this works**: The comment thread is always attached to the real source file, not the temporary input document. By using the thread's URI, we always update the note in the correct file.
- **Location**:
  - `src/extension.ts` - updated `saveNoteCommand` to use new method (lines 348-370)
  - `src/commentController.ts` - added `saveEditedNoteById()` method (lines 454-477)

**4. Removed reaction icons from comment editor**

- **Issue**: VSCode comment UI was showing reaction icons (thumbs up, etc.) that weren't needed for this extension in all operations (view, edit, history)
- **Root Cause**: The `reactionHandler` was being set in the CommentController, and the Comment interface's `reactions` property was not being controlled properly
- **Fix**:
  1. Removed the `reactionHandler` setting from the CommentController constructor (line 55-57)
  2. Ensured `reactions` property is NOT set on any comment objects (left undefined instead of empty array)
  3. Per VSCode API: If `reactions` is undefined, the reaction UI is not displayed
- **Why this works**:
  1. By not setting a `reactionHandler`, VSCode knows the controller doesn't support reactions
  2. By leaving `reactions` undefined (not setting it at all), VSCode won't display reaction UI for individual comments
  3. Setting `reactions: []` would still show the reaction UI (just empty), while `undefined` hides it completely
- **Location**:
  - `src/commentController.ts` - removed `reactionHandler` assignment (line 55-57)
  - `src/commentController.ts` - removed `reactions` property from `createComment()` method (line 118)
  - `src/commentController.ts` - removed `reactions` property from history comments in `showHistoryInThread()` (line 410)
  - `src/commentController.ts` - removed `reactions` property from editable comments in `enableEditMode()` (line 446)

**5. Fixed "command not found" errors in production VSIX (Initial attempt - v0.1.2)**

- **Issue**: Commands like `codeContextNotes.insertCodeBlock` and `codeContextNotes.addNote` were not found when using the extension installed from VSIX
- **Root Cause (Partial)**: The `activationEvents` in package.json included individual `onCommand` entries for only some commands
- **Fix (Partial)**: Simplified `activationEvents` to only use `"onStartupFinished"`
- **Location**: `package.json` - simplified `activationEvents` to only `["onStartupFinished"]` (line 36-38)
- **Version**: v0.1.2 (Partial fix - still had issues)

**6. Fixed "command not found" errors - Complete fix (v0.1.3)**

- **Issue**: Even after v0.1.2, commands like `codeContextNotes.addNote` were still not found when extension was installed from VSIX
- **Root Cause (The Real Problem)**: The `activate()` function had a fatal flaw:
  ```typescript
  if (!workspaceFolder) {
      registerLimitedCommands(context);  // Only registered 4 commands
      return;  // EARLY RETURN - never called registerCommands()!
  }
  // ... registerCommands() called here, but only if workspace exists
  ```
  When no workspace folder was detected (or before one was detected), the extension would call `registerLimitedCommands()` which only registered 4 stub commands, then RETURN early. This meant `registerCommands()` was NEVER called, so ALL commands were missing. Even worse, this could happen in production if the extension activated before the workspace was fully detected.
- **Fix**:
  1. Moved ALL command registration to the very beginning of `activate()` function, before any workspace checks
  2. Renamed `registerCommands()` to `registerAllCommands()` and removed `registerLimitedCommands()`
  3. Added workspace checks INSIDE each command that needs workspace features (noteManager, commentController)
  4. Commands now show helpful error messages if workspace is not available, rather than failing to register
- **Why this works**:
  1. ALL commands are registered immediately when extension activates, regardless of workspace state
  2. Commands are always available in command palette, keybindings, and menus
  3. Individual commands check for required dependencies (noteManager, commentController) and show friendly error messages if not available
  4. Works in ALL scenarios: with workspace, without workspace, before workspace detected, after workspace detected
- **Location**:
  - `src/extension.ts` - moved `registerAllCommands(context)` to line 29 (before workspace check)
  - `src/extension.ts` - removed `registerLimitedCommands()` function
  - `src/extension.ts` - renamed `registerCommands()` to `registerAllCommands()`
  - `src/extension.ts` - added workspace checks to commands that need them (lines 161, 204, 221, 238, etc.)
- **Version**: Fixed in v0.1.3

**7. Fixed "Cannot find package 'vscode'" error in Cursor (v0.1.5)**

- **Issue**: Extension installed from Open VSX registry in Cursor failed with error: `Error: Cannot find package 'vscode' imported from /Users/nahian/.cursor/extensions/jnahian.code-context-notes-0.1.4-universal/out/extension.js`
- **Root Cause**: The extension was using ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json) and compiling TypeScript to individual .js files, but VSCode extensions need to be bundled as CommonJS with the `vscode` module externalized. The `vscode` module is not a real npm package - it's provided by the VSCode/Cursor runtime and must be properly externalized during bundling.
- **Fix**:
  1. Installed esbuild as dev dependency for proper bundling
  2. Created `esbuild.config.js` with CommonJS output format and `vscode` as external
  3. Updated package.json scripts to use esbuild for compilation (`npm run compile`)
  4. Removed `"type": "module"` from package.json (CommonJS is default)
  5. Updated `.vscodeignore` to exclude source files and build config
  6. Extension now bundles to a single 32KB `out/extension.js` file in CommonJS format
- **Why this works**:
  1. esbuild bundles all TypeScript code into a single CommonJS file
  2. The `vscode` module is marked as external, so it's not bundled but imported at runtime
  3. CommonJS format is the standard for VSCode extensions and works in all editors (VSCode, Cursor, etc.)
  4. Bundling reduces package size and improves load performance
- **Location**:
  - `esbuild.config.js` - new file with bundling configuration
  - `package.json` - updated scripts (compile, watch) and removed "type": "module"
  - `.vscodeignore` - updated to exclude esbuild config and individual compiled files
  - `package.json` - added esbuild, @vscode/vsce, and ovsx as dev dependencies
- **Version**: Fixed in v0.1.5 (pending release)

**8. Fixed test coverage configuration (Post esbuild migration)**

- **Issue**: After migrating to esbuild, the nyc coverage tool was reporting 0% coverage and referencing a missing package `@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript`
- **Root Cause**:
  1. The `.nycrc` file was extending `@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript` which was not installed
  2. The include path `out/src/**/*.js` was incorrect - compiled files are in `out/` not `out/src/`
- **Fix**:
  1. Removed the `extends` field from `.nycrc` to avoid dependency on missing package
  2. Updated include path from `out/src/**/*.js` to `out/**/*.js`
  3. Removed redundant exclude path `out/src/test/**`
- **Why this works**:
  1. nyc now uses its default configuration without requiring additional packages
  2. Correct include path matches the actual compiled file structure
  3. All unit tests continue to pass (41 tests)
- **Location**:
  - `.nycrc` - simplified configuration (lines 1-23)
- **Version**: Fixed post-v0.1.4 (not yet released)

**Test Status After Fixes:**
- ✅ 41 unit tests passing (storageManager: 22 tests, gitIntegration: 19 tests)
- ✅ All tests compatible with esbuild bundling
- ✅ Tests run using TypeScript compilation (compile:tsc) for easier debugging
- ✅ Production extension uses esbuild for optimal bundle size and performance
- ⚠️ Coverage reporting still needs adjustment for esbuild bundled output (low priority)

**9. Fixed keyboard shortcut not opening comment editor (Post v0.1.4)**

- **Issue**: The keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+N (Cmd+Alt+N on Mac) for adding notes was using an old simple input box instead of opening the modern comment editor UI
- **Root Cause**: The `addNote` command was implemented using `vscode.window.showInputBox()` which only provides a single-line text input, while the CodeLens "Add Note" command properly uses the comment editor UI with markdown support, Save/Cancel buttons, and formatting shortcuts
- **Fix**: Updated the `addNote` command to use `commentController.openCommentEditor()` instead of `showInputBox()`, making it consistent with the CodeLens approach
- **Why this works**:
  1. The comment editor provides a better UX with multi-line input, markdown preview, and formatting toolbar
  2. Users can use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+B for bold, Ctrl/Cmd+I for italic, etc.) in the comment editor
  3. Save and Cancel buttons give users control over the note creation process
  4. Consistent behavior between keyboard shortcut and CodeLens "Add Note" command
- **Location**:
  - `src/extension.ts` - updated `addNote` command handler (lines 167-196)
- **Version**: Fixed post-v0.1.4 (not yet released)
