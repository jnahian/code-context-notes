## UI/UX Design

### Tree Structure
```
📁 Code Notes (15)
  📄 src/extension.ts (3)
    📝 Line 45: Initialize note manager and... (john_doe)
    📝 Line 120: Handle command registration for... (jane_smith)
    📝 Line 250: Error handling for edge cases... (john_doe)
  📄 src/noteManager.ts (2)
    📝 Line 30: Core business logic for CRUD... (john_doe)
    📝 Line 150: Cache invalidation strategy when... (john_doe)
```

### Node Types

**Root Node:**
- Label: "Code Notes ({total_count})"
- Icon: Folder icon
- Collapsible: Always expanded
- Children: File nodes

**File Node:**
- Label: "{relative_path} ({note_count})"
- Example: "src/extension.ts (3)"
- Icon: File icon (language-specific)
- Tooltip: Full absolute path
- Collapsible: Collapsed by default
- Children: Note nodes

**Note Node:**
- Label: "Line {line}: {preview}"
- Example: "Line 45: Initialize note manager and..."
- Description: Author name (right-aligned)
- Icon: Note/comment icon
- Tooltip: Full note content
- Command: Navigate to note on click
- Not collapsible (leaf node)

### Context Menus

**File Node:**
- Open File
- Refresh Notes

**Note Node:**
- Go to Note (default action)
- Edit Note
- Delete Note
- View History

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/
├── notesSidebarProvider.ts    (New - TreeDataProvider)
├── noteTreeItem.ts            (New - Tree item classes)
├── noteManager.ts             (Update - Add workspace queries)
├── extension.ts               (Update - Register sidebar)
└── types.ts                   (Update - Add tree item types)
```

### Data Flow
```
Note Created/Updated/Deleted
    ↓
NoteManager emits 'noteChanged' event
    ↓
NotesSidebarProvider listens for event
    ↓
Calls refresh() → fires onDidChangeTreeData
    ↓
VSCode requests getChildren() for visible nodes
    ↓
Provider queries NoteManager for notes
    ↓
Returns FileNodes and NoteNodes
    ↓
VSCode renders updated tree
```

### Configuration Options
```json
{
  "codeContextNotes.sidebar.sortBy": {
    "type": "string",
    "enum": ["file", "date", "author"],
    "default": "file"
  },
  "codeContextNotes.sidebar.previewLength": {
    "type": "number",
    "default": 50
  },
  "codeContextNotes.sidebar.autoExpand": {
    "type": "boolean",
    "default": false
  }
}
```

## Success Metrics

**User Experience:**
- Users can see all workspace notes at a glance
- Navigation to any note takes ≤ 2 clicks
- Sidebar updates feel instant (< 500ms refresh)
- Empty state guides new users to add first note
- Context menus provide quick access to common actions

**Technical:**
- No performance degradation with 100+ notes
- Lazy loading prevents unnecessary file reads
- Cache hit rate > 80% for repeated queries
- No memory leaks from event listeners
- Real-time updates without manual refresh

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Task | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Backend queries in NoteManager | 2-3 hours |
| 2 | TreeDataProvider implementation | 4-5 hours |
| 3 | Sidebar registration & commands | 2-3 hours |
| 4 | Navigation & context menus | 2-3 hours |
| 5 | Polish & empty states | 2-3 hours |
| 6 | Testing (unit + integration + manual) | 4-6 hours |
| 7 | Documentation | 1-2 hours |

**Total Estimate:** 17-25 hours (2-3 days of focused work)

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- VSCode TreeView API (stable, well-documented)
- Existing NoteManager (no changes to storage)
- File watcher API (built-in, reliable)
- Event emitter for note changes

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk: Performance with many notes**
- Mitigation: Lazy loading, caching, debouncing

**Risk: UI clutter**
- Mitigation: Collapsed by default, configurable preview length

**Risk: Real-time sync complexity**
- Mitigation: Simple event-based refresh, proven pattern

**Risk: Maintenance burden**
- Mitigation: Reuses existing infrastructure, minimal new code
