# Marketplace Preparation Guide

This guide walks through preparing the extension for publication to the VSCode Marketplace.

## Prerequisites

1. **Microsoft Account**: Create a Microsoft account if you don't have one
2. **Azure DevOps Organization**: Create an organization at https://dev.azure.com
3. **Publisher Account**: Create a publisher at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
4. **Personal Access Token**: Generate a PAT with Marketplace (Manage) scope

## Pre-Publication Checklist

### 1. Extension Icon

Create a 128x128 PNG icon:

- [ ] Design icon representing code notes/annotations
- [ ] Save as `images/icon.png`
- [ ] Ensure it looks good on light and dark backgrounds
- [ ] Test in VSCode by installing locally

**Icon Design Tips**:

- Simple, recognizable design
- Clear at small sizes
- Avoid text (hard to read at small sizes)
- Use colors that stand out

### 2. Screenshots

Create screenshots showing key features:

- [x] Adding a note (comment UI)
- [x] CodeLens indicator
- [x] Editing a note
- [x] Viewing history
- [x] Markdown formatting
- [x] Note file in `.code-notes/` directory

**Screenshot Guidelines**:

- Use high-resolution displays
- Show realistic code examples
- Highlight the extension's UI elements
- Use consistent theme (recommend Dark+)
- Annotate if needed to explain features

Save screenshots in `images/` directory:

```
images/
├── icon.png (✓ Added)
├── screenshot-add-note.jpg (✓ Added)
├── screenshot-codelens.jpg (✓ Added)
├── screenshot-edit.jpg (✓ Added)
├── screenshot-history.jpg (✓ Added)
├── screenshot-markdown.jpg (✓ Added)
└── screenshot-storage.jpg (✓ Added)
```

### 3. Demo GIF

Create an animated GIF showing the workflow:

- [ ] Record adding a note to code
- [ ] Show CodeLens appearing
- [ ] Show editing the note
- [ ] Keep it under 10 seconds
- [ ] Optimize file size (< 5MB)

**Tools for Recording**:

- **Windows**: ScreenToGif
- **Mac**: Kap, Gifox
- **Linux**: Peek, SimpleScreenRecorder + ffmpeg

**GIF Tips**:

- Focus on one clear workflow
- Use smooth, deliberate movements
- Pause briefly at key moments
- Optimize with tools like gifsicle

Save as `images/demo.gif`

### 4. Update README

Add visual content to README:

```markdown
## Demo

![Demo](images/demo.gif)

## Screenshots

### Adding Notes

![Add Note](images/screenshot-add-note.png)

### CodeLens Integration

![CodeLens](images/screenshot-codelens.png)

### Editing Notes

![Edit Note](images/screenshot-edit.png)
```

### 5. Update package.json

Update publisher and repository information:

```json
{
  "publisher": "your-actual-publisher-id",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/jnahian/code-context-notes"
  },
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/jnahian/code-context-notes/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/jnahian/code-context-notes#readme"
}
```

### 6. Version Number

Ensure version follows semantic versioning:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0" // First release
}
```

For future releases:

- Patch: `0.1.1` - Bug fixes
- Minor: `0.2.0` - New features (backward compatible)
- Major: `1.0.0` - Breaking changes

## Building the Extension

### 1. Install vsce

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

### 2. Package the Extension

```bash
# Clean build
npm run compile

# Package
vsce package
```

This creates `code-context-notes-0.1.0.vsix`

### 3. Test the Package Locally

```bash
# Install in VSCode
code --install-extension code-context-notes-0.1.0.vsix

# Test all features
# - Add notes
# - Edit notes
# - Delete notes
# - View history
# - Check CodeLens
# - Test keyboard shortcuts
# - Test configuration

# Uninstall after testing
code --uninstall-extension your-publisher-name.code-context-notes
```

## Publishing to Marketplace

### 1. Create Publisher

1. Go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
2. Click "Create publisher"
3. Fill in details:

5. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

### 3. Login with vsce

```bash
vsce login your-publisher-id
# Enter your Personal Access Token when prompted
```

### 4. Publish

```bash
# Publish to marketplace
vsce publish

# Or publish with specific version bump
vsce publish patch  # 0.1.0 → 0.1.1

3. Test installation from marketplace:
   ```bash
   code --install-extension your-publisher-id.code-context-notes
   ```

## Post-Publication

### 1. Update Repository

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Create GitHub release:

## Troubleshooting

### "Publisher not found"
