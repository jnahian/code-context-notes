# Changelog - Version 0.2.1

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-12

### Added
- **Editor Context Menu Integration** - "Add Note" option now available in editor right-click context menu for quick note creation without keyboard shortcuts

### Changed
- **Selection-based CodeLens disabled** - The "Add Note" CodeLens that appeared when selecting text has been temporarily disabled to reduce visual clutter. The context menu option provides a more intuitive alternative. This may be re-enabled with configuration control in a future release.

### Technical
- Added `editor/context` menu contribution in package.json
- Commented out selection-based CodeLens logic in `codeLensProvider.ts:80-108` with TODO marker for future re-enablement
