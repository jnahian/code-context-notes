# Version 0.1.7 - 2025-10-19

## Fixed
- **Prevented unwanted scrolling when adding notes via CodeLens**
  - Fixed issue where clicking "âž• Add Note" CodeLens button would cause the file to scroll slightly
  - Added scroll position preservation logic that captures current viewport before creating thread
  - Restores scroll position after thread creation with small delay to ensure smooth experience
  - User's viewport now stays exactly where it was when adding notes
  - Better UX with no jarring scrolling interruptions

## Changed
- **Removed automatic focus/scroll behavior when viewing notes**
  - Removed automatic cursor movement to note location when viewing notes
  - Removed automatic scrolling to center note in view
  - Users now maintain full control of their cursor position and viewport
  - Less disruptive experience - no unexpected cursor jumps or scrolling
  - More predictable behavior when interacting with notes

- **Removed cancel notification**
  - Removed "Note creation cancelled" notification when canceling note creation
  - Canceling is now a silent action - no unnecessary popup
  - Reduces notification noise and interruptions
  - Cleaner, quieter user experience

## Technical
- Updated `openCommentEditor()` with scroll position preservation (commentController.ts:246-279)
- Updated `focusNoteThread()` to remove cursor movement and reveal logic (commentController.ts:441-463)
- Updated `cancelNewNoteCommand` to remove notification (extension.ts:448-458)
