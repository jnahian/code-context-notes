# Version 0.1.5 - 2025-10-19

## Added
- **Auto-collapse all other notes when working on one** - When opening, editing, or viewing a note, ALL other comment threads are automatically collapsed to improve focus and reduce visual clutter
  - Only one note is visible at a time for better concentration
  - All other notes (both expanded and already collapsed) are ensured to be collapsed
  - Temporary threads (new notes being created) are disposed completely
  - Editing threads are disposed when switching to another note
  - Applies to all interaction methods: keyboard shortcuts, CodeLens, and edit buttons
  - Creates a cleaner, more focused editing experience

## Fixed
- **Keyboard shortcuts now use modern comment UI** (Bug #9)
  - `Ctrl+Alt+N` (Add Note) now opens the comment editor instead of a simple input box
  - `Ctrl+Alt+H` (View History) now shows history inline in the comment thread instead of opening a separate document
  - Provides better UX with markdown support, formatting shortcuts, and Save/Cancel buttons
  - Consistent experience across all interaction methods

- **+ icon comment editor now saves notes** (Bug #10)
  - Fixed issue where clicking the + icon in the editor gutter would open a comment editor but Save wouldn't work
  - `handleSaveNewNote()` now handles threads created by both our code and VSCode's native + icon
  - Falls back to finding the document by URI matching if custom properties aren't set
  - Provides clear error messages if document cannot be found

- **Test coverage configuration** (Bug #8)
  - Fixed nyc coverage tool reporting 0% coverage after esbuild migration
  - Removed dependency on missing `@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript` package
  - Updated include path from `out/src/**/*.js` to `out/**/*.js`
  - All 41 unit tests continue to pass

## Changed
- Improved comment thread lifecycle management with better editor state tracking
- Enhanced user experience by preventing multiple simultaneous comment editors
- Updated internal methods: `openCommentEditor()`, `enableEditMode()`, and `focusNoteThread()` to auto-close other editors
- **Improved labels with more relevant information**
  - New note editor: "Add your note" (clearer action)
  - View/Edit notes: Shows "Last updated [date]" if modified, or "Created [date]" if new
  - History entries: Shows action with full timestamp (e.g., "Updated on 10/19/2025 at 2:30:00 PM")

## Technical
- New `closeAllCommentEditors()` helper method in CommentController
- Better detection of temporary vs. editing vs. viewing thread states
- Improved handling of VSCode's native + icon thread creation
- Continued compatibility with esbuild bundling
