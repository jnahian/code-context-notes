## Benefits

**For Users:**
- Find any note instantly without browsing files
- Quickly locate notes by specific authors
- Filter notes by time period (e.g., "last week's notes")
- Discover related notes across the codebase
- Fast keyboard-driven workflow
- Search history prevents re-typing common queries

**For Teams:**
- Find all notes from specific team members during code reviews
- Locate all notes related to a feature or bug
- Review notes created during a sprint or time period
- Discover documentation and decisions across the project
- Better knowledge sharing and discovery

---

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes - purely additive feature
- No data migration required
- Works with existing note storage format
- Backward compatible with all existing notes
- Search can be disabled via keyboard shortcut preferences if not needed
- Search index built automatically on first use

---

## Known Limitations

- Search index stored in memory (not persisted) - rebuilds on workspace reload
- Maximum 100 results by default (configurable)
- Regex patterns limited by JavaScript RegExp capabilities
- No natural language search in initial release
- No "Replace in Notes" (bulk editing) - planned for future version

---

## Performance Notes

- Search index uses < 10MB memory for 1000 notes
- Inverted index enables sub-second search
- Background indexing prevents UI blocking
- Lazy loading for large result sets
- Debouncing prevents excessive search operations
- Index updates incrementally on note changes
