# Version 0.1.6 - 2025-10-19

## Fixed
- **CodeLens "Add Note" action now properly focuses input field**
  - Fixed issue where clicking "➕ Add Note" CodeLens would open comment editor but not focus the input
  - Enhanced `openCommentEditor()` to ensure document is shown, cursor is positioned, and UI has time to render
  - Added 50ms delay to allow VS Code to fully render the comment thread before focus
  - Improved user experience - input is now immediately ready for typing

## Changed
- **Unified note creation to use consistent method**
  - Removed + icon from editor gutter by disabling `commentingRangeProvider`
  - All note creation now goes through controlled `openCommentEditor()` method
  - Ensures consistent behavior and proper input focus regardless of creation method
  - Users should use:
    - `Ctrl+Alt+N` (Cmd+Alt+N) keyboard shortcut
    - "➕ Add Note" CodeLens button when code is selected

## Technical
- Updated `openCommentEditor()` with improved focus handling (lines 242-285)
- Removed `commentingRangeProvider` to eliminate inconsistent code paths
