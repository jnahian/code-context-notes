# Keybinding Fix for cmd+enter Save Note

## Problem
When pressing `cmd+enter` (or `ctrl+enter` on Windows/Linux) to save a note, the extension was throwing an error:
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'contextValue')
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because VS Code keybindings don't automatically pass the `comment` parameter to command handlers. When a command is triggered via a keybinding, VS Code doesn't have a way to know which comment object should be passed to the handler.

The `saveNote` command handler expected a `comment` parameter:
```typescript
async (comment: vscode.Comment) => {
  const noteId = comment.contextValue; // Error: comment is undefined
  // ...
}
```

## Solution
We implemented a tracking mechanism to keep track of which note is currently being edited:

### 1. Added State Tracking in CommentController
Added a new private field to track the currently editing note:
```typescript
private currentlyEditingNoteId: string | null = null;
```

### 2. Track Edit Mode Changes
When a note enters edit mode, we track its ID:
```typescript
async enableEditMode(noteId: string, filePath: string): Promise<void> {
  // ...
  this.currentlyEditingNoteId = noteId;
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Clear Tracking State
Clear the tracking state when:
- All comment editors are closed
- A note is successfully saved

```typescript
private closeAllCommentEditors(): void {
  // ...
  this.currentlyEditingNoteId = null;
}

async saveEditedNoteById(noteId: string, newContent: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // ...
  this.currentlyEditingNoteId = null;
  return true;
}
```

### 4. Added Helper Method
Added a public method to retrieve the currently editing comment:
```typescript
getCurrentlyEditingComment(): vscode.Comment | null {
  if (!this.currentlyEditingNoteId) {
    return null;
  }
  const thread = this.commentThreads.get(this.currentlyEditingNoteId);
  if (!thread || thread.comments.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }
  return thread.comments[0];
}
```

### 5. Updated Command Handlers
Modified both `saveNote` and `cancelEditNote` commands to handle missing comment parameter:

```typescript
async (comment?: vscode.Comment) => {
  // If comment is not provided (e.g., when triggered by keybinding),
  // get the currently editing comment from the controller
  if (!comment) {
    const currentComment = commentController.getCurrentlyEditingComment();
    if (!currentComment) {
      vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No note is currently being edited');
      return;
    }
    comment = currentComment;
  }
  // ... rest of the handler
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Keybinding Support**: Users can now use `cmd+enter` to save notes as expected
2. **Backward Compatibility**: The fix doesn't break existing functionality when the command is triggered from the UI (with the comment parameter)
3. **Better UX**: Provides a clear error message if someone tries to save when no note is being edited
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Both `saveNote` and `cancelEditNote` commands work correctly with keybindings

## Files Modified
- `src/commentController.ts`: Added tracking state and helper method
- `src/extension.ts`: Updated command handlers to handle missing comment parameter

## Testing
The fix has been:
- ✅ Compiled successfully with TypeScript
- ✅ Built for production with esbuild
- ✅ Ready for manual testing with the extension
