# Product Requirements Document: VSCode Code Context Notes Extension

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Name
Code Context Notes

### 1.2 Purpose
A VSCode extension that enables developers to attach contextual notes to specific lines or ranges of code within their projects. Notes are stored as markdown files, tracked with full version history, and integrated seamlessly into the VSCode editing experience.

### 1.3 Target Users
- Software developers working on complex codebases
- Teams needing to document code context and decisions
- Developers who want persistent code annotations beyond comments

---

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Note Management
**Description**: Full CRUD operations for code notes attached to specific line ranges.

**Requirements**:
- Create new notes for selected code lines/ranges
- Edit existing notes with full history tracking
- Delete notes when no longer needed
- Each note contains:
  - Unique identifier
  - Note content (markdown formatted)
  - Author information (git username)
  - Target file path
  - Line range (start and end)
  - Content hash of the associated code
  - Creation timestamp
  - Last modified timestamp
  - Full edit history with timestamps

### 2.2 Storage System
**Description**: Notes are stored in a dedicated directory structure within the project.

**Requirements**:
- Default storage location: `.code-notes/` directory
- Storage format: Individual markdown files per source file
- Directory structure mirrors source code structure
  - Example: `src/app.ts` â†’ `.code-notes/src/app.ts.md`
- Users can add `.code-notes/` to `.gitignore` if desired
- Automatic directory creation on first note

### 2.3 Version History
**Description**: Complete audit trail of all note modifications.

**Requirements**:
- Track every edit to a note with timestamp
- Store author information for each edit
- Maintain chronological history within the markdown file
- Display history in readable format
- Never delete historical entries (append-only)

### 2.4 Git Integration
**Description**: Automatically retrieve and use git username for note authorship.

**Requirements**:
- Read git username from repository configuration
- Fallback to system username if not in a git repository
- Store author information with each note and edit

### 2.5 Content Hash Tracking
**Description**: Track notes by code content rather than static line numbers.

**Requirements**:
- Generate hash of selected line content when note is created
- Update note position when code moves but content matches
- Detect when tracked content has changed significantly
- Handle edge cases:
  - Content deleted
  - Content modified
  - Content moved to different file

### 2.6 CodeLens Integration
**Description**: Visual indicators and actions directly in the editor.

**Requirements**:
- Display CodeLens above lines that have associated notes
- Show preview of note content in CodeLens
- Provide "Add Note" action for selected line ranges
- Click CodeLens to open note in comment UI
- Update CodeLens in real-time as notes are added/modified

### 2.7 Comment Editor Interface
**Description**: Use VSCode's native commenting API for note creation and editing.

**Requirements**:
- Integrate with VSCode CommentController API
- Display comment threads at note locations
- Support markdown formatting in comment editor
- Provide actions:
  - Add new note
  - Edit existing note
  - Delete note
  - View note history
- Comment threads appear inline in the editor

- Sync with note data model

#### 3.1.5 CodeLens Provider (`codeLensProvider.ts`)
- Implement CodeLens provider interface
- Generate CodeLens items for notes
- Handle CodeLens commands
- Update on document changes

#### 3.1.6 Content Hash Tracker (`contentHashTracker.ts`)
- Generate hashes for code content
- Track content changes across document edits
- Update note positions based on content matching
- Handle content movement detection

#### 3.1.7 Git Integration (`gitIntegration.ts`)
- Retrieve git username from repository
- Fallback to system username
- Cache username for performance

### 3.2 Data Model

#### 3.2.1 Note Structure
```typescript
interface Note {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  author: string;
  filePath: string;
  lineRange: {
    start: number;
    end: number;
  };
  contentHash: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  history: NoteHistoryEntry[];
}

interface NoteHistoryEntry {
  content: string;
  author: string;
  timestamp: string;
  action: 'created' | 'edited' | 'deleted';
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Markdown File Format
```markdown
# Notes for [filename]

## Note: [note-id]
**Lines:** [start]-[end]
**Author:** [username]
**Created:** [timestamp]
**Updated:** [timestamp]
**Content Hash:** [hash]

### Current Content
[note content in markdown]

### History
- **[timestamp]** - [author] - [action]
  > [previous content]
```

### 3.3 Extension Manifest (`package.json`)

**Activation Events**:
- `onStartupFinished`
- `onCommand:codeContextNotes.*`

**Contributions**:
- Commands for add/edit/delete notes
- Configuration for notes directory path
- Language support (all languages)

- Note files are human-readable markdown
- Performance: No noticeable lag with 100+ notes in a project

---

## 8. Technical Constraints

- Must work with VSCode 1.80.0+
- TypeScript for type safety
