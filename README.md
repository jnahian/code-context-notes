  # Code Context Notes

  Add contextual notes to your code with full version history and intelligent tracking. Notes stay with your code even when line numbers change.

## The Problem

Working on complex codebases, developers face a common dilemma:

**Traditional Code Comments:**
- ‚ùå Clutter your source files with non-code content
- ‚ùå Get committed to version control, polluting git history
- ‚ùå Mix documentation with implementation
- ‚ùå No version history for the comments themselves
- ‚ùå Can't be easily filtered or searched separately

**External Documentation:**
- ‚ùå Quickly becomes outdated as code changes
- ‚ùå Disconnected from the actual code location
- ‚ùå Requires context switching between editor and docs
- ‚ùå Hard to maintain alignment with code

**The result?** Important context gets lost, technical debt goes undocumented, and new team members struggle to understand why code exists the way it does.

## The Solution

**Code Context Notes** provides a third way: **contextual annotations that live alongside your code without being part of it.**

‚úÖ **Non-invasive** - Notes stored separately in `.code-notes/` directory, never touching your source files
‚úÖ **Intelligent tracking** - Notes follow your code even when you move, rename, or refactor it
‚úÖ **Multiple notes per line** - Add multiple annotations to the same code with easy navigation
‚úÖ **Workspace sidebar** - Dedicated Activity Bar panel showing all notes organized by file
‚úÖ **Complete history** - Every edit preserved with timestamps and authors
‚úÖ **Team collaboration** - Share notes by committing `.code-notes/` or keep them local with `.gitignore`
‚úÖ **Native integration** - Uses VSCode's comment UI for a familiar, seamless experience
‚úÖ **Markdown support** - Rich formatting with keyboard shortcuts
‚úÖ **Zero performance impact** - Efficient caching and content hash tracking  

**Perfect for:**
- üìù Documenting technical debt and TODOs
- üéì Onboarding new developers with contextual explanations
- üí° Recording implementation decisions and trade-offs
- üîç Leaving breadcrumbs for future refactoring
- ü§ù Team knowledge sharing without code pollution

```

Each note file is named by its unique ID and contains:

```markdown

**File:** src/app.ts
**Lines:** 10-15
**Author:** username
**Created:** 2025-10-17T10:30:00.000Z

## FAQ

### Do notes stay with my code when I refactor?

Yes! Notes use content hash tracking to follow code even when line numbers change. If you move code to a different location, the note moves with it.

### What happens if I significantly modify the code?

If the code content changes significantly, the note may become "stale" but is never deleted. You can update or delete the note manually.

### Can I use notes with any programming language?

Yes! Notes work with all file types and languages supported by VSCode.

### Are notes stored in my repository?

Notes are stored in `.code-notes/` directory. You can choose to commit them (to share with team) or add to `.gitignore` (to keep them local).

### Can I export my notes?

Notes are stored as markdown files, so you can read, search, and process them with any text tool. Future versions may include export features.

### How do I share notes with my team?

Commit the `.code-notes/` directory to your repository. Team members with the extension installed will see all notes.

### What's the performance impact?

Minimal. The extension uses caching and efficient algorithms. Even with 100+ notes, you won't notice any lag.

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnahian/code-context-notes
cd code-context-notes
npm install
npm run compile
```

### Running in Development

1. Open the project in VSCode
2. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
3. Test the extension in the new window

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests (fast, ~50ms)
npm run test:unit

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run all tests (requires VSCode)
npm test

# Package extension with git tagging
npm run package

# Publish to both marketplaces
npm run publish
```

**Test Coverage**: 88% overall with 100 total tests

- 41 unit tests (pure Node.js)
- 59+ integration tests (VSCode API)

See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for detailed testing documentation.

## Requirements

- VSCode 1.80.0 or higher
- Git (optional, for author detection)

## Known Limitations

- Notes are tracked by content hash; significant code changes may cause notes to become stale
- Large files (10,000+ lines) may experience slight performance impact
- Content tracking works best with unique code blocks

## Roadmap

Future enhancements being considered:

- Sidebar view for browsing all notes
- Search and filter notes across workspace
- Export notes to various formats
- Note templates
- Tags and categories
- Rich text editing
- Team collaboration features
