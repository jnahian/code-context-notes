  # Code Context Notes

  Add contextual notes to your code with full version history and intelligent tracking. Notes stay with your code even when line numbers change.

## The Problem

Working on complex codebases, developers face a common dilemma:

**Traditional Code Comments:**
- ‚ùå Clutter your source files with non-code content
- ‚ùå Get committed to version control, polluting git history
- ‚ùå Mix documentation with implementation
- ‚ùå No version history for the comments themselves
- ‚ùå Can't be easily filtered or searched separately

**External Documentation:**
- ‚ùå Quickly becomes outdated as code changes
- ‚ùå Disconnected from the actual code location
- ‚ùå Requires context switching between editor and docs
- ‚ùå Hard to maintain alignment with code

**The result?** Important context gets lost, technical debt goes undocumented, and new team members struggle to understand why code exists the way it does.

## The Solution

**Code Context Notes** provides a third way: **contextual annotations that live alongside your code without being part of it.**

‚úÖ **Non-invasive** - Notes stored separately in `.code-notes/` directory, never touching your source files
‚úÖ **Intelligent tracking** - Notes follow your code even when you move, rename, or refactor it
‚úÖ **Multiple notes per line** - Add multiple annotations to the same code with easy navigation
‚úÖ **Workspace sidebar** - Dedicated Activity Bar panel showing all notes organized by file
‚úÖ **Complete history** - Every edit preserved with timestamps and authors
‚úÖ **Team collaboration** - Share notes by committing `.code-notes/` or keep them local with `.gitignore`
‚úÖ **Native integration** - Uses VSCode's comment UI for a familiar, seamless experience
‚úÖ **Markdown support** - Rich formatting with keyboard shortcuts
‚úÖ **Tags & Categories** - Organize notes with predefined categories and custom tags
‚úÖ **Zero performance impact** - Efficient caching and content hash tracking

**Perfect for:**
- üìù Documenting technical debt and TODOs
- üéì Onboarding new developers with contextual explanations
- üí° Recording implementation decisions and trade-offs
- üîç Leaving breadcrumbs for future refactoring
- ü§ù Team knowledge sharing without code pollution

- Search results typically < 100ms
- Optimized for 1000+ notes

### Tags & Categories

Organize and categorize your notes with tags to quickly identify note types and filter related notes across your workspace.

**What are Tags?**
- Labels attached to notes for organization and filtering
- Two types: **Predefined Categories** and **Custom Tags**
- Multiple tags can be assigned to each note
- Tags appear visually in CodeLens and sidebar
- Filter notes by tags in sidebar and search

**Predefined Categories**

Built-in categories with distinctive colors and icons:

| Category | Color | Icon | Purpose |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| **TODO** | üîµ Blue | ‚úì | Tasks that need to be completed |
| **FIXME** | üî¥ Red | üîß | Code that needs fixing |
| **QUESTION** | üü° Yellow | ‚ùì | Questions that need answers |
| **NOTE** | ‚ö´ Gray | üìù | General notes and observations |
| **BUG** | üü† Orange | üêõ | Known bugs to track |
| **IMPROVEMENT** | üü¢ Green | üí° | Enhancement ideas |
| **REVIEW** | üü£ Purple | üëÅ | Code that needs review |

**Adding Tags to Notes**

When creating a new note:

1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+N` (or `Cmd+Alt+N` on Mac) to add a note
2. A tag selection UI appears with predefined categories
3. Select one or more tags from the list:
   - **Predefined Categories**: Click to select (TODO, FIXME, BUG, etc.)
   - **Recently Used**: Shows custom tags you've used before
   - **Custom Tags**: Type a new tag name and it appears as an option
4. Selected tags are highlighted
5. Click outside or press Enter to confirm
6. Write your note and save

**Examples:**

```
[TODO] Refactor this authentication logic
[TODO] [BUG] Fix race condition in user login
[QUESTION] Should we use JWT or session tokens?
[FIXME] Memory leak in image processing
[IMPROVEMENT] [custom-tag] Add caching layer
```

**Tag Autocomplete**

The tag input includes intelligent autocomplete:

- Predefined categories always appear at the top
- Previously used custom tags appear in "Recently Used" section
- Start typing to filter the list
- Type a new tag name to create custom tags on-the-fly
- Tags are automatically normalized (predefined categories ‚Üí UPPERCASE)

**Visual Tag Display**

Tags appear alongside notes in multiple places:

1. **CodeLens** (above code):
   ```
   üìù [TODO] [authentication] Note: Refactor this logic (username)
   ```

2. **Sidebar** (note preview):
   ```
   src/app.ts:45 [BUG] [critical] Memory leak in... (username)
   ```

3. **Search Results**:
   ```
   [TODO] [refactor] Line 120: Simplify this function
   ```

**Filtering by Tags**

**Method 1: Sidebar Tag Filter**

1. Open Code Notes sidebar
2. Click the üè∑Ô∏è (tag filter) icon in toolbar
3. Select one or more tags from the list
4. Sidebar updates to show only notes with selected tags
5. Click "Clear Filter" to show all notes again

**Method 2: Search with Tag Filter**

1. Open search panel (`Ctrl+Shift+F` or `Cmd+Shift+F`)
2. Click "Filter by Tags"
3. Select tags to filter by
4. Combine with text search and other filters
5. Results show only notes matching all criteria

**Tag Filter Logic:**

- **OR Logic** (default): Notes with ANY of the selected tags
- **AND Logic** (advanced): Notes with ALL of the selected tags
- Configurable in filter UI

**Managing Tags**

**Editing Tags on Existing Notes:**

1. Open the note in comment editor
2. Click Edit button
3. Tag selection UI appears
4. Modify tags as needed
5. Save changes

**Tag Validation:**

Tags must follow these rules:
- Not empty or whitespace-only
- No commas (used as delimiter in storage)
- No newlines or carriage returns
- Maximum 50 characters
- Special characters allowed: `-`, `_`, `.`, `#`, numbers

**Tag Statistics**

View tag usage across your workspace:

- Most frequently used tags appear first in autocomplete
- Tag counts visible in filter UI
- Recently used tags tracked per workspace

**Best Practices**

1. **Use Predefined Categories** for common note types (TODO, BUG, FIXME)
2. **Create Custom Tags** for project-specific contexts (e.g., `authentication`, `api`, `database`)
3. **Combine Tags** for better organization: `[TODO] [authentication] [security]`
4. **Keep Tags Concise** - use short, meaningful names
5. **Be Consistent** - reuse existing tags rather than creating similar ones
6. **Use Tag Filters** to focus on specific work areas

**Keyboard Workflow**

For fastest tagging workflow:

1. `Ctrl+Alt+N` - Add note
2. Type tag names or select from list
3. Press Enter to confirm tags
4. Write note content
5. `Ctrl+Enter` - Save

**Examples by Use Case**

```

Each note file is named by its unique ID and contains:

```markdown

**Lines:** 10-15
**Author:** username
**Created:** 2025-10-17T10:30:00.000Z

## FAQ

### Do notes stay with my code when I refactor?

Yes! Notes use content hash tracking to follow code even when line numbers change. If you move code to a different location, the note moves with it.

### What happens if I significantly modify the code?

If the code content changes significantly, the note may become "stale" but is never deleted. You can update or delete the note manually.

### Can I use notes with any programming language?

Yes! Notes work with all file types and languages supported by VSCode.

### Are notes stored in my repository?

Notes are stored in `.code-notes/` directory. You can choose to commit them (to share with team) or add to `.gitignore` (to keep them local).

### Can I export my notes?

Notes are stored as markdown files, so you can read, search, and process them with any text tool. Future versions may include export features.

### How do I share notes with my team?

Commit the `.code-notes/` directory to your repository. Team members with the extension installed will see all notes.

### What's the performance impact?

Minimal. The extension uses caching and efficient algorithms. Even with 100+ notes, you won't notice any lag.

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnahian/code-context-notes
cd code-context-notes
npm install
npm run compile
```

### Running in Development

1. Open the project in VSCode
2. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
