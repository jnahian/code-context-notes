  # Code Context Notes

  Add contextual notes to your code with full version history and intelligent tracking. Notes stay with your code even when line numbers change.

## The Problem

Working on complex codebases, developers face a common dilemma:

**Traditional Code Comments:**
- ‚ùå Clutter your source files with non-code content
- ‚ùå Get committed to version control, polluting git history
- ‚ùå Mix documentation with implementation
- ‚ùå No version history for the comments themselves
- ‚ùå Can't be easily filtered or searched separately

**External Documentation:**
- ‚ùå Quickly becomes outdated as code changes
- ‚ùå Disconnected from the actual code location
- ‚ùå Requires context switching between editor and docs
- ‚ùå Hard to maintain alignment with code

**The result?** Important context gets lost, technical debt goes undocumented, and new team members struggle to understand why code exists the way it does.

## The Solution

**Code Context Notes** provides a third way: **contextual annotations that live alongside your code without being part of it.**

‚úÖ **Non-invasive** - Notes stored separately in `.code-notes/` directory, never touching your source files  
‚úÖ **Intelligent tracking** - Notes follow your code even when you move, rename, or refactor it  
‚úÖ **Complete history** - Every edit preserved with timestamps and authors  
‚úÖ **Team collaboration** - Share notes by committing `.code-notes/` or keep them local with `.gitignore`  
‚úÖ **Native integration** - Uses VSCode's comment UI for a familiar, seamless experience  
‚úÖ **Markdown support** - Rich formatting with keyboard shortcuts  
‚úÖ **Zero performance impact** - Efficient caching and content hash tracking  

**Perfect for:**
- üìù Documenting technical debt and TODOs
- üéì Onboarding new developers with contextual explanations
- üí° Recording implementation decisions and trade-offs
- üîç Leaving breadcrumbs for future refactoring
- ü§ù Team knowledge sharing without code pollution

## Storage Format

Notes are stored in `.code-notes/` directory with one file per note:

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .code-notes/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abc123-def456-ghi789.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xyz789-uvw456-rst123.md
```

Each note file is named by its unique ID and contains:

```markdown
# Note

**File:** src/app.ts
**Lines:** 10-15
**Author:** username
**Created:** 2025-10-17T10:30:00.000Z
**Updated:** 2025-10-17T14:45:00.000Z
**Content Hash:** abc123def456

### Version Control

You can add `.code-notes/` to `.gitignore` if you want notes to be local only, or commit them to share with your team.

## Commands

All commands are available in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- **Code Notes: Add Note to Selection** - Add a note to selected code
- **Code Notes: Delete Note at Cursor** - Delete note at current cursor position
- **Code Notes: View Note History** - View complete history of a note
- **Code Notes: Refresh All Notes** - Refresh all note displays
- **Code Notes: Show Markdown Formatting Guide** - Display markdown help

## FAQ

### Do notes stay with my code when I refactor?

Yes! Notes use content hash tracking to follow code even when line numbers change. If you move code to a different location, the note moves with it.

### What happens if I significantly modify the code?

If the code content changes significantly, the note may become "stale" but is never deleted. You can update or delete the note manually.

### Can I use notes with any programming language?

Yes! Notes work with all file types and languages supported by VSCode.

### Are notes stored in my repository?

Notes are stored in `.code-notes/` directory. You can choose to commit them (to share with team) or add to `.gitignore` (to keep them local).

### Can I export my notes?

Notes are stored as markdown files, so you can read, search, and process them with any text tool. Future versions may include export features.

### How do I share notes with my team?

Commit the `.code-notes/` directory to your repository. Team members with the extension installed will see all notes.

### What's the performance impact?

Minimal. The extension uses caching and efficient algorithms. Even with 100+ notes, you won't notice any lag.

- Content tracking works best with unique code blocks

## Roadmap

Future enhancements being considered:

- Sidebar view for browsing all notes
- Search and filter notes across workspace
