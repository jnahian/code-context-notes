and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Sidebar view for browsing all notes
- Search and filter notes across workspace
- Export notes to various formats
- Note templates
- Tags and categories

## [0.1.5] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Auto-collapse all other notes when working on one** - When opening, editing, or viewing a note, ALL other comment threads are automatically collapsed to improve focus and reduce visual clutter
  - Only one note is visible at a time for better concentration
  - All other notes (both expanded and already collapsed) are ensured to be collapsed
  - Temporary threads (new notes being created) are disposed completely
  - Editing threads are disposed when switching to another note
  - Applies to all interaction methods: keyboard shortcuts, CodeLens, and edit buttons
  - Creates a cleaner, more focused editing experience

### Fixed
- **Keyboard shortcuts now use modern comment UI** (Bug #9)
  - `Ctrl+Alt+N` (Add Note) now opens the comment editor instead of a simple input box
  - `Ctrl+Alt+H` (View History) now shows history inline in the comment thread instead of opening a separate document
  - Provides better UX with markdown support, formatting shortcuts, and Save/Cancel buttons
  - Consistent experience across all interaction methods

- **+ icon comment editor now saves notes** (Bug #10)
  - Fixed issue where clicking the + icon in the editor gutter would open a comment editor but Save wouldn't work
  - `handleSaveNewNote()` now handles threads created by both our code and VSCode's native + icon
  - Falls back to finding the document by URI matching if custom properties aren't set
  - Provides clear error messages if document cannot be found

- **Test coverage configuration** (Bug #8)
  - Fixed nyc coverage tool reporting 0% coverage after esbuild migration
  - Removed dependency on missing `@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript` package
  - Updated include path from `out/src/**/*.js` to `out/**/*.js`
  - All 41 unit tests continue to pass

### Changed
- Improved comment thread lifecycle management with better editor state tracking
- Enhanced user experience by preventing multiple simultaneous comment editors
- Updated internal methods: `openCommentEditor()`, `enableEditMode()`, and `focusNoteThread()` to auto-close other editors
- **Improved labels with more relevant information**
  - New note editor: "Add your note" (clearer action)
  - View/Edit notes: Shows "Last updated [date]" if modified, or "Created [date]" if new
  - History entries: Shows action with full timestamp (e.g., "Updated on 10/19/2025 at 2:30:00 PM")

### Technical
- New `closeAllCommentEditors()` helper method in CommentController
- Better detection of temporary vs. editing vs. viewing thread states
- Improved handling of VSCode's native + icon thread creation
- Continued compatibility with esbuild bundling

## [0.1.4] - 2025-10-17

### Changed - ES Module Migration
- **Migrated to ES Modules (ESM)** from CommonJS for better compatibility with modern npm packages
- Updated `package.json` with `"type": "module"`
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to use `"module": "ES2022"` and `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`
- Added `.js` extensions to all local import statements in TypeScript source files (6 files)
- Converted build scripts to ES modules (`scripts/package.js` and `scripts/publish.js`)
- Updated all test files with `.js` extensions in imports (4 test files)
- Fixed test runners to use `import.meta.url` instead of `__dirname` (3 test runners)
- Updated `.vscodeignore` to include production dependencies in packaged extension
- All 41 unit tests passing with ES modules

### Fixed
- Fixed `Cannot find module 'uuid'` error by migrating to ES modules (uuid v13.0.0 is ESM-only)
- Fixed `Cannot find module './storageManager'` error by adding `.js` extensions to imports
- Fixed `Cannot find package 'uuid'` error by updating packaging configuration to include dependencies

### Technical
- Now compatible with uuid v13.0.0 and other ESM-only packages
- Better tree-shaking and optimization with ES modules
- All TypeScript files compile to ES modules with proper import paths
- Package size: 103KB (includes uuid dependency)

### Migration Notes
- No breaking changes to extension API or functionality
- Extension continues to work with existing `.code-notes/` directories
- All existing notes remain compatible

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- Extension now activates properly when no workspace is initially open
- Added graceful handling for commands when no workspace is available
- Improved activation events for better responsiveness
- Users now get helpful messages to open a workspace when needed

### Added
- Package testing script (`npm run test:package`)
- Better error handling for workspace-dependent operations

### Changed
- Package size optimized to 79KB (down from 81KB)
- More responsive activation events

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-17
